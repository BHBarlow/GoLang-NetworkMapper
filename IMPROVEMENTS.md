# Improvements for Go-Based Nmap Scanner

## Functionality Enhancements
- [X] 1. **Allow dynamic target input** – Use command-line arguments instead of hardcoding the IP/subnet.
- [X] 2. **Enable JSON output** – Format results as JSON for easier integration with other tools.
- [X] 3. **Use a configuration file** – Store Nmap scan flags and target IP in a `config.json` instead of modifying code.
- [X] 4. **Add a help menu** – Display usage instructions when no arguments are provided.

## Performance Improvements
5. **Optimize concurrency** – Limit the number of concurrent scans to prevent overwhelming the system.
6. **Add a timeout for Nmap scans** – Prevent the program from hanging on unresponsive hosts.

## Error Handling & Debugging
7. **Improve error handling** – Exit early when critical failures occur instead of continuing execution.
8. **Implement logging** – Save errors and scan results to a log file (`scanner.log`) for debugging.

## Usability & Packaging
9. **Provide progress indicators** – Display loading dots or scan status messages.
10. **Improve output formatting** – Make results more readable by aligning text properly.
